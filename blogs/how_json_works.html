        <h1 class="blog-title">How JSON Indices Work</h1>
        <p>I had a lot of problems on this subject. I keep trying to figure it out, and I could. But when I actually <strong>need</strong> it, it doesn't come in my head. <br> The other day it did come to my head, so I am wrote it down immediately. I described how this works below.</p>
        <br>
        <div class='blog-content'>
            <h3>What is JSON?</h3>
            <p>JSON is short form for JavaScript Object Notation and it is a data serialization format.</p>
            <p>In short forms, you can store data with it.</p>
            <p>There are stuff that are called Indices, which are used to fetch the data.</p>
            <h3>Examples for Indices</h3>
            <pre><code class="code language-json">
{
    "name": "Abdullah",

    "hobbies": ["Reading", "Coding", "Cycling"],

    "Working On": "Writing a blog"
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>So this is a normal JSON object. Now we will try to get the value of the key "name".</p>
            <p>We can do that by:</p>
            <pre><code class="code language-js">
let object = require("data.json");

let name = object["name"]; // ["name"] gets the value of the key "name". That is what we call *Keys*

console.log(name);

// Outputs: "Abdullah"
            </code></pre>
            <p>Above was a snippet of JavaScript code. It gets the JSON data from the file "data.json" and stores it inside object. Then we get the key: "name".</p>

            <h3>Array Indices</h3>
            <p>Array Indices work by specifying and index after the array name.</p>
            <p>For Example:</p>
            <pre><code class="code language-js">
console.log(object["hobbies"][0];)

// Outputs: "Reading"
            </code></pre>
            <p>Here we get the array name by typing <code class="code language-js">object["hobbies"]</code> and then specify the index.</p>
            <p>Remember, the indices always start from 0. So, if we want to get the first element in the array, we can write: <code class="code language-js">object["hobbies"][0]</code>.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>

            <p>This is how JSON Indices work.</p>
            <p>I know, it is not that hard what it seems, but sometimes it just doesn't come to our heads.</p>
